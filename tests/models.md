## Prepositions (WIP)



## Data

I tested nearly 80 ASR models from HF. All tests were on laptop. Here are the parameters:

- CPU: 12th Gen Intel Core i5-12500H, 2500 MGZ
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop / Intel Iris Xe Graphics
- Ram: 16 GB

I had two audio files in MP3 format: first is 60 seconds prepared audio with low-middle background noise, second is ~ 20 minutes not prepared audio with middle-high background noise. 
(Prepared - recorded on a speciac microphone; Not Prepared - recorded in 'real' production, for example, on real lectures).
All tests were on Russian language.

About table: 
Test 1 - prepared audio
Test 2 - NOT prepared audio
Spec. info - some of my notes may be useful
